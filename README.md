:wave: Hi, I’m Sarah, a final-year PhD student at UCL.

I work in computational neuroscience, and I'm interested in how the brain supports language comprehension processes. 
My main goal is to find a unifying model of language processing using network neuroscience. I use movies and fMRI to study the brain.
I'm currently learning how to integrate machine learning pipelines with complex naturalistic brain data. This involves, in short, annotating movie stimuli in detail, as well
as predicting what a subject was seeing/hearing from the brain acitivity patterns.
I'm looking to collaborate in anything related to graph theory algorithms and their application to neuroscience :brain:
